#gitlab

GitLab pipelines are powerful tools for automating software development tasks, such as testing, building, and deploying. With a simple configuration in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, you can define stages and jobs to ensure the quality and smooth operation of your projects.

## What is a pipeline?

A pipeline is a set of automated processes executed in a defined order. These processes allow you to:

- Verify the quality of your code.
- Ensure that all features are working (unit and integration tests).
- Automatically deploy your application.

Each pipeline is triggered by events such as a commit, a merge request, or a scheduled task.
