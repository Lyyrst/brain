The dinning plan is a week planing of all dishes you want to eat.
You can say that Monday you will eat a fish and chip's at dinner, and it will add it to your groceries list.

It will have:

	- weeks:
		- Year (String)
		- week number (Int)
		- Day:
			- date (Date)
			- Breakfast (Recipes)
			- Lunch (Recipes)
			- Dinner (Recipes)


##### explanation:
A week will contain it's year and it's week number to identify it. The day will be the object containing it's date and the 3 lunch of the day.
