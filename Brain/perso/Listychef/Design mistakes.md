### Copy Writing
Avoid **unnecessary** word. for example *Vote Page* becomes *Vote*. and if you have a *claim vote* button on the page, juste name it *claim* since we are on the vote page we dont need to say it again.
### Colors
**60-30-10 rules:**
	- 60% of neutral color
	- 30% of main color
	- 10% of attractive color

### Fonts
never more than **4 size** or **2 weight**.

### Spacing
**8 pt grid system**:
 every time you need a space choose en divisible of 8 or 4. for example, 11 becomes 12. Apply this to all decision of size with pixels.
