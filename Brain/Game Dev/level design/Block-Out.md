Block-out (or greyboxing) is a crucial phase in game level design where basic geometric shapes outline the structure and gameplay flow before detailed assets are added.

## Why Use Block-out?
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly test gameplay concepts.
- **Focus on Gameplay:** Evaluate player navigation, pacing, and engagement.
- **Iterative Design:** Modify layouts based on feedback.

## Creating a Block-out in Unreal Engine
### 1. **Use Basic Geometry Tools**
- Go to the *Place Actors* panel.
- Drag and drop *Basic Shapes* (e.g., cubes, spheres, cylinders).
- Adjust size, position, and rotation using transform tools.

### 2. **Organize Your Block-out**
- Use folders in the *World Outliner* for organization.
- Label areas (e.g., "Spawn Area," "Main Corridor," "Objective Zone").

### 3. **Test and Iterate**
- Playtest frequently using *Play in Editor (PIE)*.
- Collect feedback and adjust the layout accordingly.

## Tips for Effective Block-outs
- **Keep It Simple:** Emphasize shapes and player flow.
- **Use Metrics:** Follow standard player dimensions and jump distances.
- **Maintain Scale:** Align environment size with player and camera scales.
- **Block First, Detail Later:** Add complex assets after finalizing the layout.
